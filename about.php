	<p>
		Twin Ridge Bees is a small family farm located at the foot hills of the Appalachia Mountains in Pain Lick, KY. 
	</p>
	<p>	
		Although we specialize in raising bees for honey we also grow a variety of fresh vegetables.
	</p>
	<p>
		We're expanding! We've recently planted blueberry bushes and are investing in starwberries, serviceberries and raspberries.  Look for those at the Lancaster Farmers Market next year!
